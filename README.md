# Land-Cover-ML User Interface

( UI Link :- [https://landcoverapp.web.app/](https://landcoverapp.web.app/) )

This project is the front end of the work that has been carried out in [this](https://github.com/darkshadow013/Land-Cover-ML) Repository.

The UI of this project is just an static website which shows the images of 
	1. Ground Truth
	2. Predicted Image
	3. Dissimilarity Image

# Future Work

This project can be extended to a feature where
	
	1. Image crop picker can be created to select the portion of the ground truth image.
	2. Show the predicted and actual result.
	3. Graphs, binary image can be created using the results obtained.

Another Feature using a backend Server.
	
	1. After selection of image section backend is used to give the predicted output. This can be done without backend also.

The Backend Repository Link can be found [here](https://github.com/darkshadow013/landcover).
